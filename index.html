          <h1>Introduction</h1>
            <p>Physical exercise and staying in shape is very critical to living a healthy life. While
            many people are aware and know the benefits of this, many people struggle to consistently
            be physically active. This can be due to living a busy lifestyle, physical limitation, and/or
            a lack of motivation. The purpose of this web map, however, is to help increase motivation for
            physical exercise as well as eating healthier. Specifically, revealing obesity rates and exercise
            rates by state can raise awareness of our nations lack of healthy habits as a whole. Along with
            that, a map of gyms in Corvallis are displayed, which can help those who are making an effort to
            live a healthier lifestyle have a better idea of where to go to begin participating in an activity
            that will benefit them and that they will enjoy. While a map of these locations can be done in any
            city, this map is a simple example of how to reveal locations so users can better decide where to
            go to start exercising.

          <h1>Obesity Rates in America</h1>
            <p1>While it is important that everyone participates in physical activity regularly,
            understanding the rates of obesity by state can help assess where efforts to encourage
            more people to exercise is important. On this map are obesity rates by state as of 2017.
            States with colors closer to white or orange have low rates whereas states with darker
            colors have higher rates. As shown on the map, a lot of the western states as well as the
            northeaster states have low obesity rates. On the other hand, states in the Midwest have
            high rates but the southern states have the highest obesity rates. States with the highest
            obesity rates were West Virginia (38.1%), Mississippi (37.3%), Oklahoma (36.5%), Iowa (36.4%),
            and Alabama (36.3%), while states with the smallest rates were Colorado (22.6%), Washington
            D.C. (23%), Hawaii (23.8%), California (25.1%), Utah, and Montana (both at 25.3%). A full list
            of rates, which was the data source for this map, can be found near the end of this story map.</p1>
        </section>

        <section data-scene="scene2">
          <p>The obesity rate for Alaska is 34.2%.</p>
        </section>

        <section data-scene="scene3">
          <p>The obesity rate for Hawaii is 23.8%.</p>
        </section>

        <section data-scene="scene4">
          <h1>Exercise Rates in America</h1>
            <p1>Like with obesity rates, exercise rates by state also vary. Western, northeastern states,
            and Minnesota have average to high exercise rates. On the other hand, several midwestern
            states as well as southern states have average to low exercise rates, although there is more
            variability with exercise rates in these areas as opposed to that of the previous map. An
            interesting correlation that can be noted from this map and the obesity map is that states with
            higher obesity rates seem to be correlated with having lower exercise rates, and vice versa.
            States with the highest exercise rates are Colorado (32.5%), Idaho (31.4%), New Hampshire and
            Washington D.C. (both at 30.7%), Vermont (29.5%), and Washington (28.9%), while states with the
            lowest rates include Mississippi (13.5%), Kentucky (14.6%), South Carolina (14.8%), Indiana (15.1%),
            and Arkansas (15.7%). A link to all of the numbers can be found towards the end.</p1>

          <h1>Gyms in Corvallis</h1>
            <p1>In order to encourage others to participate in physical exercise, one step
            that can help solve this issue is revealing locations of any nearby gyms. In
            addition, knowing what amenities are offered and what membership charges are
            included helps give people more options rather than settling with one option
            that they may not be the best choice for them. Whether someone exercises or not,
            each person is looking for something different in terms of physical activity,
            such as lifting heavy weights, yoga, or even playing sports. Displayed here is
            a map of all gyms in the Corvallis area, which all came up on Google Maps. By
            clicking on each point, the name of the gym comes up, and includes membership
            prices and amenities offered. Having all of the general information about this
            on one map can help people decide which gym they will want to attend the most,
            which may motivate them to be more active in exercising. All of these locations
            have at least a three star rating on Google Maps.</p1>

          <h1>Closing Remarks</h1>
            <p>While knowing these locations can make it easier for people to exercise, it is not the
            final solution. Being physically active and healthy is all a personal choice. People can
            choose to be physically active and have a healthy diet or to be lazy and continue to eat
            food that is destructive to their bodies. Despite this, providing resources and directing
            people to locations that can help start and maintain healthy lifestyles is very capable of
            increasing low exercise rates and decreasing high obesity rates within our country. This is
            an example of how this can be made possible by the use of web maps.</p>
